Tool for running api bench mark tests via kubernetes 


This project utilizes the siege tool (https://www.joedog.org/siege-home/) for running load testing on 
an api frontend.

This project utilizes a conainerized version of the tool, allowing it to be brought up on OpenShift.
The idea being to define a set of API calls, and then scaling up the replicas to increase the load.


The included deploymentconfig and configmap yamls cover a scenario for testing the OpenShift console API

Review the deployment config to see the environmental variables (for testing against the OpenShift API
a token must first be generated and added to deploymentconfig)
